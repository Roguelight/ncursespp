Welcome to UCurses, the elegant and open-source NCurses wrapper written in C++

This GUI library was written to avoid the ugly syntax of ncurses' data structures and C pointers.
UCurses also provides an API for extending GUI components using inheritance and not worrying about storage of data. 
This document should get you started with using this awesome library.

Example class for a typical graphical interface.


class MainMenu // State object for manipulating a UCurses Window
{
    MainMenu(GUI::Ptr gui);


    Window::Ptr win;    
    Menu::Ptr modeselect;
    GUI::Ptr gui;

    void Settings();
    

}

MainMenu::MainMenu(GUI::Ptr gui)
{
    win = gui->createWindow(coord2d(30, 15), coord2d(5, 5));

    
    options = new Menu(win); // Components are initialised with a pointer of the host window
}
