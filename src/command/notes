These notes aim to cover many of the different possible implementations of
an input system for gui applications.

First off, a virtual Process() method for each widget or 'Component'. This will allow
components to perform something dependant on the key received from a window.

Something like this:

	virtual void Process(int input)
	{
		switch (input)
		{
			case ENTER:
			// Do something
			break;
			case ...
		}
	}

Secondly, we can store a bunch of function pointers in an array, then iterate over
and call each function based on an input.
