Colors in UCurses should be defined at the application level. With every application
setting up its own schemes for coloring text. This will achieve 'themed' applications
without every character having to hold color data (besides the ucurses::Canvas). Instead
the application will define a primary theme and different pairs for highlighting text.

An example of some desirable functionality shown below:

This is a string of text with one <RED>highlighted<RED> word

Here, a red highlight will need to be initialized and highlightWord called to achieve the effect.
