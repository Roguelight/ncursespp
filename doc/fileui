Goal: Specify full UI with a single text file. Callbacks might need to be hard coded

static void mainScreen(Window* win)
{
	win->loadUIFromFile("mainmenu"); // Specifies layout of widgets and content
	win->addCommand(10, // How to obtain components from window when loaded from file? std::bind(...));
}

Example file
Menu
20 12 5 5 
// Should be able to specify relative to left/right/top/bottom. "xd" to specify a ratio of window size
for example 20 12 2d 5t would mean x = win->getSize().x / 2 and y = 5 from the top
"New game" "Load Game" "Settings" // Items. Need to find a method to parse a group of var
